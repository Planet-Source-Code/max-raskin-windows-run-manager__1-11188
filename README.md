### Description

Ever wanted to get rid of annoying un-wanted or corrupt applications that starting when windows starts ?

this is the anwser!

this application enumerates and allows you to modify the registery run, run services (under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER),

modify Win.INI's Load and Run sections, and also add/remove icons from the Start Menu\Programs\StartUp folder...

and also export a backpup of the registry run to a valid .reg file
